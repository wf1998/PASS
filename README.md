We are reconstructing the code.
We originally planned to upload the trained model to the network disk for interested people to check. However, due to the large size of the file (average 2.3GB for a single model, 523GB in total), it cannot be uploaded effectively. So if you need anything, please feel free contact us by email at any time.
